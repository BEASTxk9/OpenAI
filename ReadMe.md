2. because the language of choice is php go to Openai Doc and look for php libraries (`https://platform.openai.com/docs/libraries/community-libraries`) and click the link (`https://packagist.org/packages/orhanerday/open-ai`)
3. install the packages from the php library... run this code in cmd `composer require orhanerday/open-ai` doing this will install two composer files and a folder called vendor
